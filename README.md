- **User Profiles**: Ability for users to view, update, and manage their profiles.
- **Dashboard**: Personalized user dashboards with customizable features.
- **API Integration**: Provides RESTful APIs to integrate user management with front-end or external systems.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling to ensure user data privacy and safety.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: MySQL
- **APIs**: Django REST Framework

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Django 3.2 or higher
- MySQL

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himanshu-sharmav/user_profile_management.git
   cd user_dashboard
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your MySQL database in `settings.py` by configuring the database credentials:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'your_db_name',
           'USER': 'your_username',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '3306',
       }
   }
   ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Token and Credential Files
This project uses OAuth2 for Google APIs.

### Generating Credentials
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a project and navigate to the **Credentials** section.
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and download the `credentials.json` file.
4. Move the `credentials.json` file into the project directory.

### Generating `token.json`
After placing `credentials.json` in your project directory, run the application, which will guide you through OAuth authorization and automatically generate a `token.json` file. Keep these files **private** and **out of version control** by adding them to `.gitignore`.

```bash
# .gitignore
credentials.json
token.json
```

## REST API Documentation
This project also provides RESTful APIs for user management. Below is a sample of available endpoints:

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/login**: Authenticate a user.
- **GET /api/user/{id}**: Retrieve a user's profile.
- **PUT /api/user/{id}**: Update user information.

## Deployment
This project can be deployed on any platform that supports Django and MySQL (e.g., Heroku, Render, or AWS). To deploy:
1. Configure environment variables for the database and secret keys.
2. Use `gunicorn` or another WSGI HTTP server for production deployments.

## Security Notes
- Ensure you set up HTTPS for secure communication.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and tokens.

### Next Steps:
1. **Rename the Repository**: Rename your GitHub repository from "user_dashboard" to **"user_profile_management"**.
2. **Update `.gitignore`**: Ensure you have `credentials.json` and `token.json` listed in `.gitignore` to keep these files secure.
3. **API Documentation**: Add detailed API documentation in the README for better understanding by others.

This version of the README highlights both security practices and detailed setup instructions, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project. Let me know if you need further help!
